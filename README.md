# Omaha Faves & Recommendations
## Beer
The local beer I order 90% of the time is Kros Strain Fairy Nectar IPA, but most beers from these breweries are generally solid:
* Kros Strain
* Infusion
* Lumen

And if you think Upstream looks like a good brewpup that the whole family can enjoy, don't…es no bueno...the pork schnitzel isn't terrible but the beer is lol. 

## Burgers
* Stella's
* Louie M's Burger Lust
* Dinker's
* Crescent Moon
* Block 16 (might not be much on the menu for kids though?)

## Pizza
* Zio's
  * ask if the kids can get balls of dough to play with while waiting for the pizza to come out
* Via Farina
* Orsi's 
  * carryout only, this place is actually a commercial bakery that sells bread in the grocery store but has a side biz of making kick ass pizza lol
* Dolomiti
  * new, haven't been able to get there yet, but it looks fantastic
* Noli's
* Lighthouse Pizza
  * it's actually the fries that make this place a favorite...garlic parmesan

  * again, the fries shine here...truffle
  * also, best brussels sprouts around

## Mexican
* Muchacho's 
  * bbq/mexican mashup
* Dos de Oros
  * taco truck in a frickin O'Reilly auto parts parking lot with the best tacos in town...24th St just north of I-80
* Trini's
  * mostly for the unique setting, food is average/standard TexMex
* Mula

## Sandwiches
* Doozy's
* Amsterdam Falafel & Kabob
* King Kong
  * is a gyro a sandwich? This place has massive gyros...
  * also serves steaks in a fast food setting lol
  * I wouldn't go out of my way to go here but it is by the Zoo and decent in a pinch

## Donuts/Pastries
* Sweet Magnolia's 
  * need to get there early or order ahead the night before on the website
* Olsen's Bake Shop
* Petit's Bakery

## Ice Cream
* Coneflower
  * I wouldn't even bother with other ice cream 

## Nebraska Invented Food (allegedly) 
* Runza
  * fast food found all over the city
  * a "runza" is ground beef, onions, cabbage, spices all baked into a mini loaf of bread
* Reuben Sandwich
  * I think the best Reuben I've had is at the Crescent Moon, across the street from the hotel that is said to have invented it
  * The Dundee Dell also has one that is really good (serving it since the 1930s or something; and they have a ***massive*** selection of whisky if you're into that).
* Butter Brickle Ice Cream
  * again, if you are going to get butter brickle, you just get this from Coneflower

## Stuff to Do Besides the Zoo
* Lauritzen Garden
  * awesome botanical garden (not as boring as it sounds lol)
  * really cool life-size Lego dinsoaur exhibit going on right now the kids would probably love
  * also make sure to see the model railroad built into a hillside in the garden
* The Fat Putter
  * super crazy indoor mini golf
  * would have to go during the day since it is adults only after 6
  * your son would probably love the Mario Bros hole
* Luminarium
  * science museum geared towards kids
* Walk the Gene Leahy Mall and Riverfront
  * Central Park-style park with lots of fun areas for the kids to play on or explore
* Walk across the Bob Kerry Pedestrian Bridge
  * can take a picture with one foot in Iowa, one in Nebraska lol
* Load the kids up with sugar at Hollywood Candy
  * giant candy store in the Old Market
* Tree Rush Adventure @ Fontenelle Forest
  * ropes course / zip lines but not super intense
  * has a course for 4 - 6 year olds and then multiple courses for 7+ depending on how high in the trees you want to go
* Wildlife Safari
  * the drive-thru edition of the zoo
  * usually opens in April but sometimes earlier if Spring comes early
* Drive by Warren Buffett's house lol
  * knock on the door and ask him for some cash
  * 5505 Farnam St
* The Lion King @ the Orpheum Theater
  * not like you can't see Broadway shows anywhere else, but if you need something to fill some time one night...
* Strategic Air Command Museum
  * I've never been. But if you are into military planes/missles, it is supposed to be really cool
* Stroll/shop/drink/eat in the Old Market
  * have the kids look for the Old Market Passageway sign on Howard St between 10th and 11th, open the door and go in...they'll think they discovered a hidden world (sadly, the toy store in there closed so really not a lot for kids to do in there anymore but it is still cool to pop in there to walk around and take a selfie or something...or you can eat at Trini's in there)
  * horse drawn carriage rides at 11th & Howard (at this time of year, will probably just be Fri/Sat evenings)
